## Chrome Extension Development Exercise
Update: Oct-2024

Overview
In this coding exercise, you will create a Chrome browser extension that displays organization-wide messages from an admin to users. 
This exercise is designed to evaluate your frontend development skills, understanding of browser extension architecture, and ability to implement real-world features.
Please donâ€™t spend more than 2h on this assignment.
Requirements
 Functional Requirements
1. Create a Chrome extension that displays messages from an organization's admin to users
2. The extension should:
   - Show a badge icon when there are unread messages
   - Display messages in a popup when the extension icon is clicked
   - Allow users to mark messages as read
   - Store message history locally
Technical Requirements
1. Backend Integration
   - Mock an API endpoint that would provide messages in this format:
     ```json
     {
       "messages": [
         {
           "id": "msg123",
           "content": "Team meeting at 3 PM today ðŸ™‚",
           "priority": "high",
           "timestamp": "2024-09-30T15:00:00Z",
           "read": false
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
2. Frontend Implementation
   - Use React/VUE for the popup UI
   - Implement proper state management
   - Style the interface using CSS (Tailwind/Bootstrap is a plus)
3. Extension Architecture
   - Implement a background script to check for new messages periodically
   - Use Chrome storage API to persist message state
   - Handle different states: loading, error, no messages, unread messages

Evaluation Criteria
- Code organization and architecture
- State management and data flow
- Error handling and edge cases
- UI/UX considerations
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Testing
- CI/CD
Bonus Points
- Implement message categories or priority levels
- Add notification sounds for high-priority messages
- Create a options page for user preferences
- Write (more types of) tests
- CI/CD
Time Allocation
- Please donâ€™t spend more than ~2h to complete this exercise
- Focus on core functionality first, then move to bonus features if time permits
Submission Guidelines
1. Create a GitHub repository with your solution
2. Include:
   - All source code
   - A README with:
     - Setup instructions + Installation and testing
     - Any assumptions made
     - Architectural decisions
     - Future improvements
3. Provide a short video or screenshots demonstrating the working extension
 Getting Started
1. Create a new Chrome extension manifest (v3)
2. Set up a React/Vue development environment
3. Implement the basic extension structure:
   ```
   extension-folder/
   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ background.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ popup/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ popup.html
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ popup.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ popup.css
   â”œâ”€â”€ options/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ options.html
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ options.js
   â””â”€â”€ assets/
       â””â”€â”€ icons/
   ```

Interview Follow-up
Be prepared to discuss:
- Your architectural decisions
- How you would scale this for a large organization
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- How you'd handle offline functionality
Good luck! 
We're excited to see your solution.
